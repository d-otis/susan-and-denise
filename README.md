## Jacob's Notes

Wow, this looks so great! Thank you so much, Dan! I see what you're saying with the Harpies on the mobile version. I agree that it is better to have the video player not scaled down any further for the mobile layout. And the size of "contact" doesn't bother me at all.

### Harpy Options

1. Would it be possible within the mobile layout to lower the video player so the harpies feet are visible and shrink our names so they don't overlap the harpies?

1. Or maybe lower the harpies below the video player to frame "contact" and shrink the contact a bit to fit between them?

Other than that I think it's perfect and you did an amazing job, as per usual. If none of these changes work in your opinion, I'm willing to part with the harpies on the mobile version
